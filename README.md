# Embedded Programming Projects

This repository contains embedded systems projects developed as part of the Computer Engineering program at the Federal University of Itajubá (UNIFEI).

## Overview

The goal of this collection is to explore and apply fundamental concepts in embedded programming using the **PIC18F4520** microcontroller. Projects range from basic peripheral control to more complex systems involving real-time data display, user input, and hardware integration.

## Contents

- **Lab_embedded_programming/**
  - **clock_with_date/** — Displays real-time clock and date on a 16×2 LCD using the PIC18F4520.
  - **temperature_control/** — Implements a temperature monitoring system with PWM-controlled fan and LCD feedback.
